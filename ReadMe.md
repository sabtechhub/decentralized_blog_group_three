## ‚öôÔ∏è 4.0 How It Works  

### üîπ Initialization
- The application initializes Web3 and connects to the Ethereum network

**Post Creation**  
1. Users connect their wallet  
2. Fill in post details (title, content, optional image)  
3. Images are uploaded to IPFS  
4. Transaction is sent to the blockchain to create the post  

**Post Viewing**
